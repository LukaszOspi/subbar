            sub_bar academy is a music course for deaf and hard of hearing
            people, based on subfrequencies instead of sound. over 72 hours, our
            participants will learn how to compose and perform using this new
            creative medium, choosing their instruments from a variety of
            options, both hardware and software. <br></br>
            <br></br> We promote inclusion by committing to the absence of sound
            as the main carrier of information in our artwork; artworks can
            create sound, in fact, the higher subfrequencies are hearable, but
            the sense of touch should always be enough to grasp the artistic
            message in its integrity.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            We will launch a call for hearing impaired and deaf people (18-40
            years old) to join our Sub_Bar Academy in Lisbon, Berlin and Vienna.

              Sub_Bar Academy is a mixed format of residency and workshop, where
              participants will learn by doing: during 72 hours, our
              participants will learn how to use various instruments and tools
              to create and perform using low vibrations (sub frequencies), both
              individually and in groups. At the end, the participants will be
              invited to create your own piece, to perform a collective show in
              their city, and will have the possibility to enter our roster of
              artists.

              Every participant will receive the equivalent of 1000â‚¬ in cash and
              equipment, and we will provide sign language interpretation for
              the workshops.

              Practical part of the course will last for 36 hours (80%
              attendance is mandatory), where participants will have freedom and
              autonomy. During this time, participants will be encouraged to
              create compositions based on a weekly theme, such as synthesizers,
              effects, among others. Teachers will be available to supervise the
              first independent sessions, and after these, they will be
              available through online communication if participants need
              assistance. Participants will receive a free license of Ableton
              Live Suite, and a SubPac haptic vests.
