            Welcome to Sub_Bar, a creative environment based on subfrequencies
            and vibrations, and a meeting point between hearing and deaf
            cultures. We empower artists, businesses, and organizations
            worldwide with the tools and expertise they need to create local
            events, and we nurture their communities through educative programs,
            strategic partnerships, and open calls. We promote an alternative,
            intense, and trance-inducing format where the art of "listening" is
            a task for the whole body, creating shared memories and inspiring
            tomorrow's technologies. This community of artists and researchers
            is held together by curiosity, innovation, and mutual learning, in
            pursuit of the next beautiful thing.

              we create a new art form and creative language that uses
              subwoofers and tactile technology to interact through the sense of
              touch. Set in an aesthetic-artistic context, Sub_Bar aims to
              promote inclusion as an opportunity and a task for all of us. Sub
              frequencies are low-frequency sounds, that are mainly perceived by
              the body rather than our ears: differently than sound, they are
              not directional (left or right, front or back), and they trigger a
              sense of full immersion. Low frequencies stimulation is not a
              novel field, in fact, its beneficial effect has been clinically
              studied over the last two decades. This physical and aesthetic
              experience triggers a sense that has always been in the
              background, growing its memories, curiosity, and its language.
              With music in mind, Sub_bar gives voice to that background,
              through the vision of the best artists out there.

              we are eufonia - eufonia is an interdisciplinary platform that
              explores the relationship between art, science and culture through
              the medium of sound. since 2021, we promote compositions and
              performances from hearing and deaf artists who work with this new
              medium, creating vibrations that can be felt throughout the body,
              to creating unique and intense experiences.we took inspiration
              from music education and multisensory research to establish a new
              creative language, and after hosting regular events in Lisbon,
              Berlin, Leipzig, and KÃ¶ln, we are about to launch sub_bar in the
              rest of Europe, creating even more possibilities to connect,
              create, and perform.
